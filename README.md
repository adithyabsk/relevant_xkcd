## Plan

- [x] Get Data
- [ ] Figure out how to get main topics of a random piece of text
  * Use this to be able to benchmark eventual solution
- [ ] Look into search metrics for suggestion relevance which you can use to
measure the later steps
- [ ] Build simple version of idea that uses just cosine similarity with title
- [ ] Build more complex version that uses simple machine learning model to
predict relevance using NLP techniques
- [ ] Try GPT-3 semantic search approach
